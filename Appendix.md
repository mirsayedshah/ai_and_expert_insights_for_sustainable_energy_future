<p><strong>Appendix A:</strong></p>

<hr />
<p>This appendix contains the Python language code used to analyze potential AI and ML techniques applications in various energy policy scenarios while considering sustainability requirements. The code performs the following steps:<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Define criteria and sub-criteria related to energy policy scenarios.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Construct a pairwise comparison matrix for criteria.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Normalize the pairwise comparison matrix to obtain criteria weights.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Define the weights for the criterion of sub-criteria.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Calculate the overall weights of sub-criteria.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Define alternatives for exploration.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create a performance matrix for each alternative, evaluating their performance against the sub-criteria.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiply the performance matrix by the overall sub-criteria weights to obtain a weighted performance matrix.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Normalize the weighted scores for each alternative.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Print the results, including criteria weights, sub-criteria weights, overall sub-criteria weights, weighted performance matrix, and normalized scores.<br />
The code provides insights into the relative importance of different criteria and sub-criteria for energy policy scenarios and the evaluation of alternative solutions. The results can be used to inform decision-making processes and guide the development of energy policies that leverage AI and ML techniques while addressing sustainability requirements.</p>
